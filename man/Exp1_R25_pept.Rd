\title{Exp1_R25_pept dataset}
\format{
An object of class \link{QFeatures} related to peptide
quantification. It contains 6 samples divided into two conditions
(25fmol and 10fmol) and 13918 peptides.

The data frame exprs(Exp1_R25_pept) contains six columns that are the 
quantitation of peptides for the six replicates. 

The data frame fData(Exp1_R25_pept) contains the meta data about the peptides.

The data frame pData(Exp1_R25_pept) contains the experimental design and gives 
few informations about the samples.

\description{
This dataset is the final outcome of a quantitative mass 
spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of two samples containing different 
concentrations of 48 human proteins (UPS1 standard from Sigma-Aldrich) 
within a constant yeast background (see Giai Gianetto et al. (2016) for 
details). It contains the abundance values of the different human and 
yeast peptides identified and quantified in these two conditions. The two 
conditions represent the measured abundances of peptides when respectively 
25 fmol and 10 fmol of UPS1 human proteins were mixed with the yeast extract 
before mass spectrometry analyses. This results in a concentration ratio of 2.5. 
Three technical replicates were 
acquired for each condition.

The dataset is either available as a CSV file (see 
inst/extdata/Exp1_R25_pept.txt), or as a \link{QFeatures} structure 
(Exp1_R25_pept). In the latter case, the quantitative data are those of the 
raw intensities.
